# BBAU-Minor-Project
BBAU Student Database Management System can be used by education institutes to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.
